[Compare changes](https://github.com/ArthurKun21/fga-preview/compare/16a1815a...d0860904)

### Fixes

- Not optimized initialization of Tesseract caused some devices to crash.
- We were using too much threads for Tesseract. Moved the Tesseract back with others to the service scoped threads.
- Added some excpetion handling for Tesseract and optimized the initilization of regex for reused.

### Feature

#### Use OCR on Apple Count

- Crash on Apple Refill screen is due to Tesseract crashing. We have now added a new option to skip the usage of OCR for more accurate reading of apples used.

  <img width="685" height="146" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af42bb78-c2bc-4e5e-ae4c-ccc2bba170f9" />

  This is found on `settings` -> `Battle` -> `Use OCR on Apple Count`.

  In case you didn't knew, Enabling `Over Recharge AP` would use the max apples available when refilling apples instead of normally only using 1 at a time.

#### Level Servant Script
- Fixed the "execute" button not being handled for welfare servants
- Also tested that the trial welfare servant will correctly stop the script once it reached its max level. We weren't sure due to the UI change.

#### Skill Maker
- Added Button hints for Shiki. But if you ever don't want to upgrade yet you can use Dante's options in the mean time.

  <img width="1073" height="560" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8eff6c3f-e035-4353-8ac8-c59767507cbe" />

- Added various servant icons to help you decide the button to choose. Also you can't click on that servant icons.

  <img width="1085" height="558" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e636bcd4-1250-4659-a824-8b80d5e42f74" />

- Fixed the buttons hint are only occupying the current space, we have now made it so it can go beyond the screen. Sorry about that.

Fixes:

### Teapots Fix

- It is now back to just normal turn on or off

  ![HD-Player_pxRSu8YtaQ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53f43d48-668a-452b-af87-8786e59e0330)
  
- It will now always check the teapots section at party and repeat screen, if it needs to turn on or off depending if you check âœ… the usage
- If you are on the last run and you still have remaining teapots in the configuration, it will now attempt to turn it off regardless.
  This should help you ~~and me~~ to not accidentally use Teapots on non-high bond quests.
- The above condition doesn't apply to Ordeal Call Free Quest if you ran out of Storm Pods, as we have no way of turning it off once the quests ends.

### Grand Servants Fix

- We have updated the detection regions for both normal as well as support image maker.
- Removed the warning for `Above lvl 100` with the new updated detection region as it seems fairly consistent at Grand Duels
  
  <img width="549" height="76" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b42dfa86-d03a-47ac-b452-16ba2ce63170" />


Experiment:
- We have introduced a dedicated thread to Tesseract(OCR) to check if it will improve the NP level detection. As well as we have updated its detection region.
  Let me know if it somehow improved.

Fixes:
- disabling the skip filter for JP will cause an infinite loop on CE leveling, now it will always auto ON the auto fill
- Made a mistake when translating my jupyter notebook for experiment to the app code that cause incorrect detection area for searching friends with grand servants. We have now fixed it

Breaking:
- We are now removing the root screenshot feature for future improvement of codebase.

Saw some reports with crashing and going to disable this for a while.

For context, this runs in the background using kotlin thread. And this might be a problem when paired with the 
kotlin coroutines, which where automation scripts run with, both fighting for the same resources causing a crash.

Return back the `Reset All` to its old functionality and introduce a new button `Default` in which will now inherit the returning of values to their default value.

<img width="398" height="271" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc0d9542-f7c0-463c-845d-03905bbf2e9f" />

---

Fix the is Max ascended for the Grand Servants. This is causing issues the last few grand duels 
if you turn it on due to the fact that it wasn't adjusted for the Grand Servants.

Notice that the `Max ascended` star is a lot lower on the Grand Servant than Normal Servant.

We have now taken into account both situations.

| Grand Servant | Normal Servant|
|:--:|:--:|
| <img width="177" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d312894-1f1f-47f8-991b-7299bfdff82c" /> | <img width="190" height="201" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd8f4f92-49f5-40dd-98a4-2c23e8bd1d9d" /> |

---

We have made a mistake in the previous logic for the Grand Servants selection. 
Before even if you set it up to select Grand Servants there's a chance to select
a normal version of it.

| Grand Servant | Normal Servant|
|:--:|:--:|
| <img width="300" height="170" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/384c8651-8bd5-4a5c-9f34-385a87d8699a" /> | <img width="165" height="168" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2102bb67-7aaf-4b1b-a1ca-12db271d424e" /> |

We have now updated the logic that if you set it up to find Grand Servant it would check for Grand Servant Settings

Such Settings are any of the following:
- You have selected to find if there's Bond CE/NP Charge on Slot 2
- You have setup to find a CE on Slot 3
- You are searching for either Grand Servant Tag(Fixed lvl 100 or Lvl 100 and above)

---

The following are now added to Default Support Servants to help to the upcoming Extra 1 Grand Duel and beyond
- Mash
- Jalter
- Arcueid
- Kagetora (Ruler)
- Ciel
- BB Dubai
- U-Olga Marie

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After the installation of the APK, you have to go to `Settings` -> `Storage` -> `Extract Default Support images`

App was crashing when starting the script service. This is a side-effect code to fix the initialization of play button.
Due to bug in the code it causes to have negative left location causing the crash. We have now added a lower bound in order to prevent that.

---

We have copied code from Mihon's codebase in order to display some crashing issues.

### Updated the Support Text Information

Updated the UI to also display the full information including Grand Servant Configuration

#### Battle Configuration Screen

<img width="551" height="368" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd49e4ad-5621-48a0-b596-f696fb72eec4" />

The initial value of per item in the configuration will always be "1" but by resetting in the battle launcher it would then reset to whatever default value you inputted.

Whenever you completed your inputted number of runs, it would also reset to whatever default you have inputted instead of "1"

To disable it, on the battle launcher

- chore: update AutoLottery to GiftBox template image (#501) (@ArthurKun21)
- fix: Prevent OC teapots from being incorrectly enabled in subsequent runs (#502) (@ArthurKun21)
  - Added explanation: If you have storm pods and used them with teapots. When you ran out of storm pods, you would return back to menu and the next time you have did runs the teapots are turned on but the Teapots mode in the app is on neutral, meaning it won't alter the state of the teapots. Meaning you might accidentally use teapots even if you don't want to. This change will make the Teapots mode to turned off, meaning it will check and if it was turned on it would turned it off, to prevent accidental usage.
