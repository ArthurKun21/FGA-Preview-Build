# Auto Level CE and CE EXP Bomb Differences

## Overview

FGA Preview offers two distinct scripts for enhancing Craft Essences (CEs): **Auto Level CE** and **CE EXP Bomb**. Understanding the differences between these two modes is crucial for effective CE management.

### Auto Level CE

The Auto Level CE script is designed to enhance a specific target Craft Essence that you have selected. It will continue to feed fodder CEs to the selected CE until it reaches its maximum level. This mode is ideal when you want to focus on leveling up a particular CE.

### CE EXP Bomb

The CE EXP Bomb script, on the other hand, is intended for mass enhancement of multiple CEs for CE EXP bomb usage. In this mode, the script will automatically select and enhance CEs from your inventory without requiring you to select a specific target CE beforehand. This is useful for quickly boosting the levels of several CEs at once.

## How to Use Each Mode

### Using Auto Level CE

1. Navigate to **Enhancement → Craft Essence** in the game.
2. **Select the CE you want to level**.
3. Click the play button to start the Auto Level CE script.
4. The script will detect it has a selected CE and enhance it until it runs out of fodder or reaches max level.
5. Stop the script when done.

### Using CE EXP Bomb

1. Navigate to **Enhancement → Craft Essence** in the game.
2. Ensure no CE is selected in the enhancement slot.
3. Click the play button to start the CE EXP Bomb script.
4. The script will automatically select CEs from your inventory to enhance.
5. Stop the script when done.
