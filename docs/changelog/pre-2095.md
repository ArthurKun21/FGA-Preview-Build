Fixes:
- disabling the skip filter for JP will cause an infinite loop on CE leveling, now it will always auto ON the auto fill
- Made a mistake when translating my jupyter notebook for experiment to the app code that cause incorrect detection area for searching friends with grand servants. We have now fixed it

Breaking:
- We are now removing the root screenshot feature for future improvement of codebase.
