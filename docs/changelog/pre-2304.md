## Fixes

- Updated the Quest Reward template image for NA server as it appears to have been updated.
- Updated the skill confirmation template image for TW server
- Fixed the repeat FP summon logic due to missing template image for 100x summon.

## Feat

- Added Reliquary of Departed Souls to the materials list. I actually forgot about this.
- Added fallback method for FP summon when 100x summmon isn't detected. It uses the `sell` button to determine that we are on the repeat fp summon screen.
