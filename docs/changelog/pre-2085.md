App was crashing when starting the script service. This is a side-effect code to fix the initialization of play button.
Due to bug in the code it causes to have negative left location causing the crash. We have now added a lower bound in order to prevent that.

We have copied code from Mihon's codebase in order to display some crashing issues.

Finally figured out what was wrong with my code and it is no longer ugly again.
