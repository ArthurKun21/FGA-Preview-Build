Return back the `Reset All` to its old functionality and introduce a new button `Default` in which will now inherit the returning of values to their default value.

Fix the is Max ascended for the Grand Servants. This is causing issues the last few grand duels 
if you turn it on due to the fact that it wasn't adjusted for the Grand Servants.

Notice that the `Max ascended` star is a lot lower on the Grand Servant than Normal Servant.

We have now taken into account both situations.

We have made a mistake in the previous logic for the Grand Servants selection. 
Before even if you set it up to select Grand Servants there's a chance to select
a normal version of it.

| Grand Servant | Normal Servant|

We have now updated the logic that if you set it up to find Grand Servant it would check for Grand Servant Settings

Such Settings are any of the following:
- You have selected to find if there's Bond CE/NP Charge on Slot 2
- You have setup to find a CE on Slot 3
- You are searching for either Grand Servant Tag(Fixed lvl 100 or Lvl 100 and above)

The following are now added to Default Support Servants to help to the upcoming Extra 1 Grand Duel and beyond

- Mash
- Jalter
- Arcueid
- Kagetora (Ruler)
- Ciel
- BB Dubai
- U-Olga Marie

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> After the installation of the APK, you have to go to `Settings` -> `Storage` -> `Extract Default Support images`
