## Fixes

- Stepper is going to take in the boundary on initialization to ensure that it wouldn't go out of bounds such as `-1` in teapots/runs/ etc
- Updated the Skill Maker to use the full width in order to display the text more clearly

## Possible breaking changes

- We have migrated from shared preferences to Preference Datastore, while everything is working fine so far be sure to Backup your configs in case that there was a problem.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Be sure to backup your configs before updating to this release. Just incase that there was a problem with the migration.
> I already used it and so far found no problem but it is still better to backup just incase.
