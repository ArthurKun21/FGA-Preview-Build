Fixes:

### Teapots Fix

- It is now back to just normal turn on or off

- It will now always check the teapots section at party and repeat screen, if it needs to turn on or off depending if you check âœ… the usage
- If you are on the last run and you still have remaining teapots in the configuration, it will now attempt to turn it off regardless.
  This should help you ~~and me~~ to not accidentally use Teapots on non-high bond quests.
- The above condition doesn't apply to Ordeal Call Free Quest if you ran out of Storm Pods, as we have no way of turning it off once the quests ends.

### Grand Servants Fix

- We have updated the detection regions for both normal as well as support image maker.
- Removed the warning for `Above lvl 100` with the new updated detection region as it seems fairly consistent at Grand Duels

Experiment:
- We have introduced a dedicated thread to Tesseract(OCR) to check if it will improve the NP level detection. As well as we have updated its detection region.
  Let me know if it somehow improved.
