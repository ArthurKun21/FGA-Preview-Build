## Fixes

- Apple count could go over 999, we are now fixing this by increasing the max apple count to 9,999.
- Apple count would be fixed in between 0 and 9,999.
- Import Battle configs results in some information to be lost(NP Level, Default Runs, etc) due to incorrect numeric type conversion. Fixed the conversion logic to properly parse the numbers.

## Feat

- We have now successfully migrated from the old Tesseract to modern PaddleOCR for our OCR operations. This now should result in more accurate readings.
- As a result of the OCR migration, NP Level Detection for EN and JP server is now a bit more reliable. 
- Remove the `Use OCR on Apple Count` preference as it is no longer needed with the new OCR engine.
- Moved Order Change to the main Skill Maker screen for easier access
- Added delay(1.2 seconds) for subtitles before turn start for EN server.
