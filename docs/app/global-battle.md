#### Story Skip Limitation

The feature will get stuck when a story requires user input to make a choice and cannot be skipped. We do not currently plan to address this limitation.

### Boost Item

FGO used to have items in events to boost performance of servants. Not much nowadays.

This will make the SQ which is a premium currency to be hidden by default for resource refill. Will prevent accidental usage.
