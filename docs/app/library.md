# Library

## Overview

Library controls how the battle configuration list is organized and displayed. You can reorder and hide server tabs to focus on the servers you play, and choose a sorting method that matches how you pick configs.

## Key Features

### Customize server tabs

Tap **Library Tabs** to open a screen where you can:

- **Reorder tabs** – Drag the handle icon to move a server tab up or down. The order here determines the order in the Library tab bar.
- **Show or hide tabs** – Tap the visibility icon to hide a server you do not use. Hidden servers no longer appear in the Library tab bar, reducing clutter.
- **Default tab** – The first tab labeled "Default" shows all configurations regardless of server and cannot be hidden.

Available servers:

| Server  | Description                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Default | Shows all configs.                      |
| EN      | North American / Global server configs. |
| JP      | Japanese server configs.                |
| CN      | Chinese server configs.                 |
| TW      | Taiwan server configs.                  |
| KR      | Korean server configs.                  |

### Choose a sorting method

Select **Config sorting** to pick how configurations appear in the Library:

| Sort option   | Behavior                                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name A–Z      | Alphabetical order, ascending.                           |
| Name Z–A      | Alphabetical order, descending.                          |
| Most Used     | Configs with the highest run count appear first.         |
| Least Used    | Configs with the lowest run count appear first.          |
| Recently Used | Configs used most recently appear first.                 |
| Oldest Used   | Configs that have not been used in a while appear first. |

The selected sort applies across all tabs, and the app remembers your choice between sessions.

## Tips for Best Results

- Hide servers you do not play to keep the Library tab bar short and uncluttered.
- Use **Recently Used** sorting if you frequently switch between a small set of configs.
- Use **Most Used** sorting to keep your go-to farming configs at the top.

## Troubleshooting

- **Tabs not updating:** After hiding or reordering tabs, return to the Library and swipe to refresh.
- **Sorting seems off:** Make sure you selected the intended sort option; the preview updates immediately in the list.
- **Hidden tab still visible:** Confirm the visibility toggle is off (eye icon crossed out) and exit back to the Library.
- **After changing config's server, it doesn't appear in the right tab:** Try scrolling to another tab and back, or restart the app to refresh the Library view. Currently, server tab changes do not reflect instantly.
