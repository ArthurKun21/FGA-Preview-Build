# Materials Selection

The Materials screen lets you choose which materials FGA should track during farming sessions. Selected materials determine what FGA counts on drop screens and can trigger automatic stops when you've collected enough.

## Overview

Materials in Fate/Grand Order come in different rarities and categories. FGA organizes them into tabs for easy browsing:

- **Copper** - Common materials like Proofs, Bones, and Fangs, plus class-specific blue gems
- **Silver** - Mid-tier materials like Seeds, Feathers, and Pages, plus class pieces and red gems
- **Gold** - Rare materials like Hearts, Scales, and Lores, plus class monuments and gold gems

## Key Features

### Material Selection

Select materials by tapping them in the list. Selected materials appear highlighted with a checkmark.

| Unselected State         | Selected State                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard list appearance | Highlighted with primary color and checkmark icon |

Tap a selected material again to deselect it.

### Search Materials

Find materials quickly using the search bar at the top of the screen.

1. Tap the search field or the floating search button
2. Type the material name (partial matches work)
3. Results filter in real-time across all rarity tabs
4. The tab badges show how many materials match in each category

Search is case-insensitive, so "bone" finds "Bone" and "Horseshoe" finds matches containing those letters.

### Rarity Tabs

Switch between material rarities using the tab bar:

| Tab        | Materials Included                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Copper** | Proofs, Bones, Fangs, Dust, Chains, Stingers, Fluids, Stakes, Gunpowder, and more. Also includes blue skill gems for all classes. |
| **Silver** | Seeds, Ghost Lanterns, Crystals, Jewels, Feathers, Gears, Pages, and more. Also includes class pieces and red skill gems.         |
| **Gold**   | Claws, Hearts, Dragon Scales, Spirit Roots, and other rare materials. Also includes class monuments and gold skill gems.          |

Each tab shows a count of how many materials you've selected in that category.

### Toolbar Actions

The floating toolbar at the bottom provides quick actions:

| Button     | Action                                                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reset**  | Restore selections to what they were when you opened the screen |
| **Undo**   | Reverse your last selection change                              |
| **Clear**  | Remove all selected materials                                   |
| **Search** | Toggle the search keyboard                                      |

The Reset button only appears when your current selections differ from the initial state.

## Tips for Best Results

### Select Only What You Need

Choose only materials that actually drop in your target quest. Selecting too many materials slows down detection and may lead to false positives.

### Use Search for Specific Materials

When farming for a specific material, use search to jump directly to it instead of scrolling through tabs.

### Check Tab Counts Before Farming

The numbers on each tab show your selected materials per rarity. Verify these match your farming plan before starting a run.

### Reset When Switching Quests

If you change farming locations, consider using Clear to remove all selections, then pick fresh materials for the new quest.

## Troubleshooting

### Materials Not Being Detected

If FGA isn't counting your target materials:

1. Verify the material is selected (has a checkmark)
2. Confirm the material actually drops in your quest
3. Check that you haven't hit the material limit in your battle config

### Search Shows No Results

If search returns empty:

1. Check your spelling
2. Try shorter search terms
3. Clear the search and browse manually

### Selections Not Saving

Material selections save automatically to your battle config. If selections aren't persisting:

1. Make sure you exit the screen normally (back button)
2. Don't force-close the app before changes sync

### Wrong Materials Selected After Undo

The undo system tracks each individual change. Multiple rapid taps may create multiple undo states. Use Reset to return to the original state if undo behaves unexpectedly.
