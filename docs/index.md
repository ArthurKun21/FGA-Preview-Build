## Features

We implemented some of the following features.

    - Auto Level Append
    - Auto Level CE
- Updated Scripts
    - Friend Gacha going to Level CE upon max inventory.
    - Looping of Lotto to Gift Box for much easier management.
    - Long Press on Lotto for faster opening of boxes.

- Stop script upon reaching certain bond level.

## Features removed

- **Auto Spam**

    I currently don't have the capability to maintain this feature. But I will say I wish to create a better implementation of it in the future.

- **Screen recording**

    Currently removed it as newer versions of android no longer allow taking screenshots and recording video at the same time.

- **Root screenshot**

    Removed to simplify the codebase and I don't even used it.
