## Requirement

Due to the nature of long press gesture, the **minimum Android version of this fork is 8.0**

## What is this?

This is a fork version of Fate/Grand Automata (FGA) with different development priorities and some other features.

## Should you use it?

If you are looking for stability and a more polished experience, use the main FGA app.

## Features

We implemented some of the following features.

- New scripts
    - Auto Level Skills
    - Auto Level Append
    - Auto Level CE
- Updated Scripts
    - Friend Gacha going to Level CE upon max inventory.
    - Looping of Lotto to Gift Box for much easier management.
    - Long Press on Lotto for faster opening of boxes.
- Find Appends on Support
- NP Level Detection
- Auto Send of Friend Request after clearing a quest.
- Auto on/off toggle of Teapots.
- Stop script upon reaching certain bond level.
- Command Spell
- Grand Duels

## Features removed

- Auto Spam

    I currently don't have the capability to maintain this feature. But I will say I wish to create a better implementation of it in the future.
