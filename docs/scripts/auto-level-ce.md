# Auto Level CE

The auto level CE script have two modes.

1. **Auto Level CE**: This mode will automatically level up your Craft Essence (CE) up until the target CE is maxed or you run out of fodder CEs.

2. **Auto CE Bomb**: This mode automatically levels either 1★ or 2★ Craft Essences (CEs) depending on the configuration. Unlike "Auto Level CE" mode, it does not stop when the current target CE reaches max level; instead it selects a new CE and perform the leveling process again. It only stops when you run out of fodder CEs or you perform manual stopping intervention.
