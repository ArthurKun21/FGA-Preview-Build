# Auto Level Skills

This is a script that lets you automate the leveling of your skills. By tapping and reading the skill level programmatically, you can level up your skills with just initial setup.

## How to get started

1. Go to Skills screen.
2. Select servant you want to level up its skills.
3. Click the play button to start the script.
4. Setup the target level you want to reach.

## Exit scenarios

- Ran out of materials.

    When one of the skills you are currently leveling up cannot proceed to due to lack of materials, the script will stop leveling up that skill and move on to the next one.

- Ran out of QP
  
    The script will stop leveling up skills when you run out of QP. You can resume the script once you have enough QP to continue.

- Reached the target level

    When the script has leveled up all the skills to the target level, it will stop automatically.
