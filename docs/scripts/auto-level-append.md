# Auto Level Append

This is a script that lets you automate the leveling of your append skills. Unlike the "Auto Level Skills", it does not have the capability to read the level text on screen due to technical limitations and instead requires configuration from user on how many level up they must perform for the certain append skill.

## How to get started

1. Go to the Append Skills screen.
2. Select the servant you want to level up its append skills.
3. Click the play button to start the script.
4. Setup the configuration options as desired.

## Exit scenarios

- Ran out of materials.

    When one of the skills you are currently leveling up cannot proceed to due to lack of materials, the script will stop leveling up that skill and move on to the next one.

- Ran out of QP

    The script will stop leveling up skills when you run out of QP. You can resume the script once you have enough QP to continue.

- Reached the target level

    When the script has leveled up all the skills to the target level, it will stop automatically.
